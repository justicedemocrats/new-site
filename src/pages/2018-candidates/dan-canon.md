blurb: >-
  Dan is a civil rights attorney who has spent his career fighting for those who
  would not otherwise have a voice in the justice system. He was part of the
  team that successfully fought for marriage equality in all 50 states before
  the United States Supreme Court, and he represents victims of white
  supremacist violence incited by Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential
  campaign. Dan believes that healthcare is a basic human right, that the role
  of dark money in politics must come to an end, and that we must invest in the
  working class. When elected, he will be a voice for all â€“ not just a select
  few.
