blurb: >-
  While our representatives argue about whether or not to raise the minimum
  wage, families are struggling to make rent. Dorothy Gasque is running for
  Congress in Washingtonâ€™s 3rd district to reform our government and return
  power to the people rather than the corporate interests Congress currently
  represents.
