blurb: >-
  As a community leader and civil rights activist in the Lehigh Valley for 20
  years, Greg Edwards will bring a deep understanding of the intersectionality
  between core progressive values to Capitol Hill. He believes it’s time to
  reclaim what it means to be a democrat — free from lukewarm moderation — by
  fighting for campaign finance reform, Medicare for All, equitable education
  funding, free college tuition, economic justice, and civic empowerment.
