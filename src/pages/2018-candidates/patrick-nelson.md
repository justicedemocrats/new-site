blurb: >-
  Patrick made the decision to dedicate his life to public service in 2011
  before entering his senior year at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI),
  where he studied Biochemistry and Biophysics. He realized that at a time when
  science and technology is becoming a greater part of our daily lives, that
  there is a need for lawmakers that are literate in these areas. For the past
  several years, Patrick has been a grassroots activist and was elected as a
  Delegate for Sen. Bernie Sandersâ€™ 2016 Presidential Campaign. He has seen
  first-hand the failures of the Democratic Establishment and is committed to
  building a new model for campaigning and public service.
