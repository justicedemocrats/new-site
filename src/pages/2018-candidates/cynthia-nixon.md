blurb: >-
  Cynthia grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and in Yorkville, where
  she was raised by her single mother in a one bedroom, fifth-floor walk-up
  apartment. She is a lifelong New Yorker, actor, and progressive advocate who
  is running for governor to fight for a better, more equal New York. Unlike the
  current leadership in Albany, Cynthia rides the New York subway nearly every
  day, and understands the toll that the mismanagement of the MTA is taking on
  everyday New Yorkers. A lifelong Democrat, Cynthia is a well-known, outspoken
  advocate for LGBT equality, public education, and womenâ€™s reproductive rights.
