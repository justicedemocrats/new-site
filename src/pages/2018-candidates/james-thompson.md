blurb: >-
  James is a civil rights lawyer who pulled himself out of poverty and
  homelessness through hard work, education, and service as an Army infantryman
  in the Presidential Honor Guard. He has fought against homelessness and for
  equality for all in the working class communities of his district throughout
  his entire career. James is bringing that tireless energy to his campaign
  against a vulnerable incumbent who is bought and paid by the Koch brothers.
