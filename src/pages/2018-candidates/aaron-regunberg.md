blurb: >-
  Aaron was raised by his single mother and extended family - like his
  grandmother, Bunny, a Planned Parenthood chapter executive and his Grandfather
  Ralph, a refugee from the Holocaust. He founded the Providence Student Union,
  which has improved the life of countless students in Providence. Since his
  election to the General Assembly, Aaron has led winning, grassroots campaigns
  to support working families, reform our criminal justice system, and expand
  renewable energy. In the days after the 2016 election, he helped bring more
  than 1,000 people together, packed in a school cafeteria to plan their state's
  response, and since then they have built a strong network across Rhode Island.
