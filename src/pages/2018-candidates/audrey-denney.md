blurb: >-
  Audrey Denney has never found a place she loves more than the North State. She
  is running for Congress in California's 1st District because she believes that
  the people of the North State deserve better. They deserve a representative
  who will respect and listen to them and who will fight for their needs and
  concerns in Washington D.C. She believes that the job is not about partisan
  politics, but about bringing people together, and finding a way forward as a
  community, a region, and a nation.
