blurb: >-
  Kaniela is a Native Hawaiian and Progressive State Representative with a
  history of successful grassroots campaigns based on big, progressive ideas. At
  age 22, he beat a Tea Party Republican, despite getting outspent 10-1 by
  personally knocking on 15,000 doors. Now he is running for Congress in
  Hawaiiâ€™s 1st district on the boldest platform Hawaii has ever seen.
