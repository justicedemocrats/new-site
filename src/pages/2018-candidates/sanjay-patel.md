blurb: >-
  Sanjay is a first-generation immigrant and former small business owner who is
  running to represent Floridaâ€™s 8th congressional district. As local
  opportunities expand in space travel and exploration, Sanjay aims to ensure
  fair wages and reasonable cost of living for teachers, firefighters, service
  professionals and all working people. Sanjay supports Medicare for All,
  reducing interest rates on student debt, and fair taxation that ensures that
  hardworking Floridians and small business owners don't foot the bill for
  infrastructure and public services that disproportionately benefit big
  businesses and billionaires.
