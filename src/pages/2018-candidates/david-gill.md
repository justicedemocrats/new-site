blurb: >-
  David Gill is a former Justice Democrat that ran in Illinois' 13th District.
  As an Emergency Room doctor, David bears witness to the overwhelming failures
  of the for-profit private health insurance industry on a daily basis. Heâ€™s
  been a member of Physicians for a National Health Program for the past 25
  years, and he looks forward to continue working to move us to the single-payer
  system which has been denied to us for far too long.
