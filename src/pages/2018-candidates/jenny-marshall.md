blurb: >-
  Jenny Marshall is a public school teacher and community organizer. She is
  running because for far too long our families and communities have been
  ignored, dismissed and disenfranchised. Wall Street and huge conglomerates
  have put profits over people. This must change. Jenny is prepared to step up
  and fight for all of us in Washington. That means passing Medicare-for-all,
  investing in our future and helping to create economic equity for all people.
