blurb: >-
  It’s time for genuine leadership that puts the lives and livelihoods of
  everyday Texans first. It’s time for leaders who serve the people of Texas,
  not the special interests. Linsey Fagan is running to represent Texas’ 26th
  district because, for too long, Texans have been without accountable
  leadership in Washington.
