  Ilhan Omar is the congresswoman for Minnesota's 5th district. Born in Somalia,
  Ilhan and her family fled the country's civil war when she was eight years
  old. They lived in a refugee camp in Kenya for four years before coming to the
  United States, and eventually settling in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood of
  Minneapolis, in 1997. In 2016, Ilhan became the first Somali-American, Muslim
  legislator in the United States. She has been a devoted progressive activist
  for many years, advancing important issues like educational access,
  environmental protection, and racial equity.
