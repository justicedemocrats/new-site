blurb: >-
  Christine has spent the last 12 years as CEO of Vermont's largest locally
  owned utility, Vermont Electric Coop, becoming the first CEO in the country to
  transition on the job. Christine was inspired to run for governor after
  watching Vermont’s current governor fail to deliver for marginalized and
  working Vermonters. In focusing on rural economic development, quality public
  education, environmental justice, and a continued pursuit of delivering
  Medicare for all, Christine will bring her history of progressive leadership
  to the governor’s office.
