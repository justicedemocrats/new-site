blurb: >-
  Juana Matias, an immigrant and one of the first Latinas to serve in her state
  legislature, is running to represent the 3rd Congressional District of
  Massachusetts. Her experience as both a social worker and a lawyer makes her
  uniquely qualified to represent underserved communities and fight to make the
  American dream accessible to all, not just those born into wealth and power.
