blurb: >-
  Randy Bryce is a U.S. Army veteran, cancer survivor, and union iron worker. He
  joined the race for Wisconsin’s 1st Congressional District because his values
  are our neighbors’ values, and Washington has gotten way off track. In
  Congress he will fight for Medicare for All, a living wage at $15/hour,
  combating racism, and campaign finance reform.
