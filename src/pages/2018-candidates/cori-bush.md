blurb: >-
  The people of Missouri's 1st district need a representative who understands
  their struggles and will fight for real solutions. Cori Bush is a former
  teacher, a registered nurse and a pastor. She's a single mother and an engaged
  citizen. More importantly, she's a fighter. This is not the time for baby
  steps. Incremental change is no change at all when families are struggling to
  put food on the table or find justice in the streets. Cori is running to bring
  transformative change to St. Louis and all of Missouri's 1st. Stand with Cori,
  because she stands by you.
