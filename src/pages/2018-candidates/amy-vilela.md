blurb: >-
  Amy Vilela in Nevadaâ€™s 4th District believes that we don't have time to wait
  for career politicians, their donors, or special interests to do the right
  thing -- she will fight and will never stop advocating for Medicare for All, a
  $15/hour living wage, a Green New Deal, and democratic and electoral reforms
  that remove Big Money from politics.
