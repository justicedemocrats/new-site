blurb: >-
  Dr. Abdul El-Sayed is running for governor to make state government work for
  all Michiganders, and not just the privileged few. Abdul is a Rhodes scholar,
  physician and public health expert who, as Detroitâ€™s health commissioner,
  launched a program to ensure every child who needed one got a free pair of
  glasses. Abdul is running on a platform of bold, progressive ideas to address
  gaping inequality between the rich and poor.
