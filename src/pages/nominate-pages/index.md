  ## **SUBMIT A NOMINATION**


  (No self nominations please!)


  No single candidate can carry this movement for working-class Americans alone.
  That’s why we’re recruiting candidates from districts all across the country
  who will take the courage of their convictions -- for a Green New Deal,
  Medicare for All, racial justice, and so much more -- into the 2020 Democratic
  primary field and give clear voice for so many working-class Americans. 


  The days of political theatrics are over. We need fearless action, now. It’s
  #OurTime. 


  But we need your help. Along with your friends, family, co-workers, neighbors,
  former classmates, anyone you know to submit nominations here on an ongoing
  basis. We're accepting nominations for:


  * **People** you think will make great Justice Democrats, and also

  * **Districts** where maybe you don’t know anyone but you think needs a
  Justice Democrat in the primary field.


  Thanks for your time, your commitment, and support.

**Is the next Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the next Rashida Tlaib, the next Ilhan Omar, or the next Ayanna Pressley in your district?**

Help us find them by nominating a candidate, or by nominating a district where you want to help find a great candidate. 

We're focused on recruiting candidates to run in districts where the incumbent Democrat is out-of-touch with the voters of the district.
