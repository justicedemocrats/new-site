    preface: >-
      We are searching for bold, compelling working-class leaders to run for
      Congress as Justice Democrats in 2020. Is the next Alexandria
      Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, or Ayanna Pressley in your district? Help us
      find them by nominating a candidate or by nominating a district where you
      want to help find a great candidate.


      **What we’re looking for:**


      * Bold leaders who will represent and mobilize their communities to fight
      for the Justice Democrats platform, from Medicare for All to the Green New
      Deal to ending mass incarceration and deportations. 

      * Grassroots campaigners who will run on Big Organizing over Big Money --
      inspiring volunteers across the district, and rejecting all corporate PAC
      and lobbyist donations.

      * Movement builders who know that to truly transform our country and the
      Democratic Party, it's not just about winning one race. We're ushering in
      a new generation of leaders who'll fight side-by-side with each other and
      with our movements.


      **Let us know more about yourself, your district, and why you are so
      excited about Justice Democrats!** We’ll need some information to stay in
      touch throughout the process, please fill out the form as best you can.
      Let’s take the first step together!

**Opinion polls in the United States demonstrate that these policy positions are overwhelmingly popular.** Indeed, throughout the industrialized world these ideas are considered moderate. This is a movement about freedom and justice. And it’s a movement of, by, and for working people. If the Democrats refuse to embrace this platform, they’ll continue to lose, either to Republicans or to us.
