  **We thank all the candidates** for running on a platform including Medicare
  for All, Money Out of Politics, Livable Wage, Green Energy, and Equality and
  Justice for all people. We are proud to call them Justice Democrats.
intro: >-
  In 2018, we ran a broad slate of candidates from across the country — most of
  whom we counted on you to nominate. Some had been previously involved in
  politics but most are running for the first time. They were (and are)
  educators, nurses, small business owners, and local community organizers.
  Every one of them concerned about their community, our country, and making
  sure every person has the same protections, rights, and opportunities.
