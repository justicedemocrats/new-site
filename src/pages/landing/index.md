  The Democratic Party needs to fight back. But the corporate wing of the party
  keeps getting in the way. 
introContent: >-
  **In the era of Donald Trump and his billionaire cabinet, we will fight for an
  America that belongs to all its people.** We are unafraid of taking on
  out-of-touch incumbents in primary challenges because we don’t need to just
  elect more Democrats, we need to elect better Democrats. 


  **It’s time to usher in a new generation of diverse working-class Democrats**
  who have a bold vision to transform our economy and democracy.

  We need a Democratic Party that fights for its voters, not just its corporate
  donors. 

  That’s why we helped elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to Congress. We need
  leadership 

  in the Democratic Party that will represent and fight for our communities.

      **We recruited and helped Alexandria pull off one of the biggest upsets in
      American history.** But the top of the Democratic Party is still
      disproportionately wealthier, whiter, and more male than the base. 


      **Now it’s time for more leaders in the Democratic Party who don’t just
      represent corporate donors, but the voters of the Democratic Party:**
      women, people of color, young people, and working-class people of all
      backgrounds to help build our progressive movement.

      "Polling data demonstrates the Democratic Party’s base of voters are ready
      for a more progressive agenda. Though the party elites may be 'divided'
      the base is not; they are ready for unabashed progressive politicians." —

      **The Democratic Party needs to fight for something.** Progressive
      policies like Medicare For All, free public college, and marijuana
      legalization are popular with voters. It’s time to fight for them.
