title: Communications and Messaging
reference: F2M1
templateKey: ignore-fragment
preface: >-
  Our movement is founded on a bold vision of justice. Successful candidates are
  able to articulate their message, weaving together that larger vision with
  practical concerns in the district. Communications strategy is critical at all
  stages of the campaign, attracting volunteers and grassroots donors, winning
  the media battle, and of course gaining the support of primary and general
  election voters. In this section, please explain how your campaign's
  communication strategy will come together - the core messaging, the key
  policies, and the media strategy. Please note: there is no prize for speed
  here! Take your time and think through each question. We recommend writing
  your answers out in a separate document and getting plenty of feedback from
  others before submitting to Justice Democrats.
