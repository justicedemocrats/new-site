  ## Tell us how will you speak to your community


  Our movement is founded on a bold vision of justice. Successful candidates are
  able to articulate their message, weaving together that larger vision with
  practical concerns in the district. Communications strategy is critical at all
  stages of the campaign, attracting volunteers and grassroots donors, winning
  the media battle, and of course gaining the support of primary and general
  election voters. In this section, please explain how your campaign's
  communication strategy will come together - the core messaging, the key
  policies, and the media strategy. 


  Please note: there is no prize for speed here! Take your time and think
  through each question. We recommend writing your answers out in a separate
  document and getting plenty of feedback from others before submitting to
  Justice Democrats.
