  ## Tell us how you are going to win votes


  Justice Democrats win their elections with hard work and dedication, knocking
  on doors, making phone calls, reaching out to communities across their
  district. We are a part of a larger movement, replacing big money with big
  organizing. Tell us how you are thinking about running your field and outreach
  programs. Do your research and be as detailed as possible. Use these questions
  below as a starting block, talk to others on your team and in your community,
  and learn about voters in your district. This is the start of something big!


  Please note: there is no prize for speed here! Take your time and think
  through each question. We recommend writing your answers out in a separate
  document and getting plenty of feedback from others before submitting to
  Justice Democrats.
