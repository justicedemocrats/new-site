  ## Tell us more about your candidate


  Justice Democrats redefine who can run for office. We want working class
  heroes, people who understand first hand the struggles of their communities,
  leaders with a clear vision and a strong moral compass. But campaigns are
  tough, and it is important that our candidates are prepared for the battles
  ahead. Please use this form to tell us more about your candidate, their
  background, their cirles, and their beliefs. 


  Please note: there is no prize for speed here! Take your time and think
  through each question. We recommend writing your answers out in a separate
  document and getting plenty of feedback from others before submitting to
  Justice Democrats.
