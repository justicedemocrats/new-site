    intro: >-
      We need a bold economic vision that will both reclaim lost capital and put
      money back in the pockets of hard-working Americans, and create millions
      of new jobs for those who have been left out of the workforce.
    planks:
      - contents: >-
          The idea behind a federal jobs guarantee is that anyone who wants to
          work and contribute but can’t find a way to do that in the economy can
          do that. A federal jobs guarantee program would establish a floor for
          wages and benefits for the nation’s workforce. This program would
          provide a baseline minimum wage of $15 an hour and guarantee for
          public workers a basic benefits package, including healthcare and
          childcare. By investing in our own workforce, we can lift thousands of
          American families out of poverty and get people to work doing the work
          that needs to be done.
        title: Enact a Federal Jobs Guarantee
      - contents: >-
          This is about justice and basic human decency. If you work hard and
          you work full time you shouldn’t live in poverty. Furthermore, we
          support strong unions and collective bargaining.
        title: Secure a Living Wage and Tie it to Inflation
      - contents: >-
          Scientists are sounding the alarm on climate change. In order to avoid
          the worst case scenario and a dystopian future we need a massive green
          revolution. It’s time to drastically and immediately move away from
          fossil fuels and develop the technologies of the future. This will be
          a giant boon to both the private and public sector, as well as a
          necessary response to a global crisis. We can and we must be #1 in
          sustainable energy production in the world.
        title: Create the Renewable Energy Revolution
      - contents: >-
          Our infrastructure gets a grade of D from the Society of Civil
          Engineers. The government should invest trillions in rebuilding our
          crumbling roads, bridges, schools, levees, airports etc. There’s no
          reason why we can’t have the world’s #1 infrastructure.
        title: Build the New New Deal
      - contents: >-
          As a result of NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China and the WTO, Americans
          have lost millions of decent paying jobs. It’s time to end the race to
          the bottom and renegotiate these rigged deals that only benefit
          elites. We should not sacrifice our sovereignty, the only people who
          are allowed to make laws for the United States should be the American
          people, not multinational corporations.
        title: Block Bad Trade Deals
      - contents: >-
          Corporations dodge $450 billion a year in taxes by using offshore tax
          havens. We should end this injustice, as well as chain the capital
          gains tax to the income tax, increase the estate tax, and implement
          the Buffet Rule so that no millionaire CEO pays less in taxes than his
          or her secretary. It’s time for a tax system that benefits the
          middle-class and the poor, and makes the top 1% and multinational
          corporations pay their fair share.
        title: End Tax Dodging and Loopholes
      - contents: >-
          The United States maintains 800 military bases worldwide at a cost of
          $100 billion a year. This is money that can be spent at home creating
          jobs, rebuilding infrastructure, and investing in the future of the
          people. The disastrous war in Iraq cost trillions, the war in
          Afghanistan is going on 17 years in with no end in sight, and we’re
          currently bombing 7 different countries. We spend more on our military
          than the next 8 countries combined. Despite countless lives lost and
          destroyed, terrorism has only gotten worse. It’s time to end the wars
          and the perverse monetary-incentive structure that makes politicians
          flippant about sending young men and women to die. Unilateral U.S.
          military force should only be used as a last resort to defend the
          nation. The current budget could be cut drastically if we used our
          department of defense for what it was intended — defending us, instead
          of waging interventionist wars.

    intro: >-
      The growing disparities in income and wealth among our nation’s citizenry
      have long-term impacts on our population — for wealth accumulation, debt
      reduction, and educational attainment.
    planks:
      - contents: >-
          The United States should catch up to every other modern nation and
          implement a single payer, Medicare for All system. There’s no reason
          we can’t be #1 in the world instead of #37. It’s time to end the
          destruction of American health care by rapacious, price gouging,
          for-profit, private health insurance middlemen.
        title: Healthcare as A Right
      - contents: >-
          Educating the citizenry of a nation pays dividends in the long run,
          with the economy getting back much more than is initially put in.
          Crushing student debt for higher education would no longer burden
          young men and women trying to improve their lives through hard work.
          We should strive to have the best education system in the world.

          Republicans have been trying to privatize and cut earned benefit
          programs for decades. Corporate Democrats have been willing to go
          along with them under the guise of a ‘grand bargain’ and ‘reform’. We
          pledge to staunchly oppose this. Social Security reduced the elderly
          poverty rate from 35% to 10%. 3.4 million Americans would immediately
          fall into poverty without Medicaid. Gutting these vital programs is
          not an option.

          The United States is one of just three countries in the world that
          doesn’t offer paid maternity leave, the others being Oman and Papua
          New Guinea. We are the only industrialized nation that doesn’t offer
          paid vacation time. This should be changed immediately.

          Xenophobia and racism are running rampant in the nation, emboldened by
          the hate-filled rhetoric spilled by the nation’s 45th president across
          the news and social media. Amid this hatefulness and fear mongering,
          African Americans and Hispanics in particular, and people of color
          generally, have been targets in our nation’s continued assault against
          their rights, liberties, existence, and humanity. As did generations
          before us, we will continue to advocate and push for justice, equity,
          and equality in all manner and forms, and will sponsor and vote on
          legislation to secure the same.
        title: Fight For Racial Justice
      - contents: >-
          We support the Paycheck Fairness Act. We oppose Republican cuts to
          Planned Parenthood and women’s health clinics all across the country.
          In 2016 alone, 60 TRAP laws targeting abortion were passed in 19
          states. We will vigorously oppose all efforts to dismantle
          reproductive rights.
        title: Protect Women’s Rights

          More than 600,000 Americans are homeless on any given night, including
          over 57,000 veterans. Studies show the cost of leaving a homeless
          person on the streets is $30,000 while the cost of housing them is
          just $10,000. Addressing this crisis is both the moral and fiscally
          responsible thing to do.
        title: Combat Homelessness
      - contents: >-
          We believe in the core idea of policing — to serve and protect the
          community. Police are a vital part of American society and that is why
          it’s so important to reform the system to make it serve all Americans.
          For-profit policing and for-profit prisons should be abolished. Police
          training should be retooled to emphasize de-escalation tactics, and
          body cameras should be mandatory on all officers. Furthermore,
          community oversight boards should be created and broken windows
          policing should be eliminated. Stop & frisk — which disproportionately
          targets blacks and latinos 87% of the time — has a 97% failure rate.
          On top of being discriminatory and ineffective, it’s also
          unconstitutional and should be ended. Special prosecutors must also be
          appointed to hold police accountable.
        title: Law Enforcement Reform
      - contents: >-
          92% of Americans want expanded background checks, 54% want a ban on
          assault weapons, and 54% want a ban on high capacity magazines. We
          agree with the majority of the American people and support these
          measures. Over 30,000 Americans die every year from gun violence,
          including over 10,000 homicides. The time to act is now to address
          this public health crisis.
        title: Enact Common-Sense Gun Regulation
    title: Protect Our Rights

    intro: >-
      We cannot afford to continue partisan jockeying on these issues, there is
      too much at stake. Americans must be provided a better chance to succeed
      in the face of rising income inequality and continued machinations by
      corporate giants.
    planks:
      - contents: >-
          ICE was created in 2003 as a reaction to 9/11. Since then, it has
          turned into a state-funded terror group that regularly violates basic
          human rights. We don't need a special enforcement agency for
          undocumented immigrants. We can rely on our existing criminal justice
          agency to arrest those who have committed a crime, just like we did
          before 2003.
        title: Abolish ICE
      - contents: >-
          Super PACs should be banned, private donations to politicians and
          campaigns should be banned, and a clean public financing system should
          be implemented to end the takeover of our government by corporations
          and billionaires. Americans deserve free and fair elections — free
          from the corruption of big money donors. The Supreme Court has
          effectively legalized bribery. It’s time for an Article 5 convention
          to take our Democracy back from the brink of Oligarchy.
        title: End Corruption
      - contents: >-
          Ban the NSA from bulk data-collection and warrantless spying. Shut
          down Guantanamo Bay and all extrajudicial prisons. Prosecute torturers
          and those who violated the Geneva Conventions, Nuremberg Tribunal,
          International law and US law. Defend habeas corpus and due process.
          Pardon whistleblowers like Edward Snowden. We shouldn’t be leading
          from behind on human rights; we must be the home of liberty. We should
          practice the values we preach.
        title: Stop Constitutional Overreaches
      - contents: >-
          America imprisons more people than any other nation in the world. With
          4.4% of the world’s population, America incarcerates 22% of the
          world’s prisoners (716 per 100,000). Even as the national crime rate
          remains on a steady decline, incarceration rates continue to climb. On
          top of that, our criminal justice system currently targets Black and
          Brown people leading to higher arrest rates and longer sentences. That
          needs to end.


          Criminal justice reform requires sweeping and comprehensive policy
          changes that reverse our nation’s trends of unjust mass incarceration,
          and works to address the root causes of criminal behavior while
          mitigating the negative consequences of inappropriate policing
          practices.
        title: Reform Our Criminal Justice System
      - contents: >-
          We won’t give an inch in our opposition to Trump’s outrageous
          proposals. Ideas like a ‘total and complete’ shutdown of Muslim
          immigration and deporting all undocumented immigrants are anathema to
          America. We will fight for comprehensive immigration reform with a
          path to citizenship. America is a proud nation of immigrants.
        title: Implement Comprehensive Immigration Reform
      - contents: >-
          Ban arming human rights violators. We recently gave Saudi Arabia
          billions in weapons and watched the civilian death toll in their
          vicious bombing campaign in Yemen tick up. We continue sending Egypt
          arms as they violently crack down on peaceful protesters. Israel
          received $38 billion in aid and promptly announced new settlements.
          The first step to peace is not enabling nations who regularly violate
          international law. We must be bold enough to stand up to human rights
          violators who aren’t just our enemies, but our allies. We don’t weaken
          our allies by holding them accountable, we strengthen them.
        title: No Longer Sell Arms to Human Rights Violators
      - contents: >-
          The goal is legalization, taxation, and regulation. Prohibition only
          makes drug cartels more powerful, increases crime, and makes drugs
          more dangerous due to lack of enforced safety standards. What you put
          in your body is your own business, and your right. A free society
          should allow individuals to make their own choices about their bodies.
          While most users are recreational and moderate, rehabilitation and
          treatment should be provided for people struggling with addiction.
          Additionally, those serving time for non-violent drug offenses should
          be pardoned.
        title: End the Failed War on Drugs
      - contents: >-
          Humans are fallible, we’ll never get the right answer 100% of the
          time. 4% of the people on death row are not guilty of a crime and have
          been wrongly convicted. A system that puts innocent people to death is
          indefensible and should be reformed. We want justice for the American
          people but killing innocent people on death row is the exact opposite.
        title: Abolish the Death Penalty
      - contents: >-
          We must speak out against racism, sexism, xenophobia, and all forms of
          bigotry. Non-discrimination protections that currently apply to race,
          religion, and gender should be expanded to include the LGBTQ community
          and the atheist community. Making all Americans equal is not asking
          for special privileges, it’s asking for the rule of law—justice and
          equality for all as promised in the United States Constitution.
        title: Oppose Bigotry

          These days, our reliance on technology has become second-nature, and
          the Internet has become a great enabler of industry, connectivity, and
          commerce. For all the wonders the internet provides, its benefits are
          fragile in that at any moment, large corporations seeking to pad their
          bottom lines and deliver outsized returns to their shareholders can,
          at any moment, hinder our access to the Internet - a platform for
          freedom of expression and medium for improving our lives.




          For more than a decade,  the Internet has served as a great equalizer,
          and has provided an opportunity and platform for small businesses and
          voices (who may not otherwise have a platform to compete in the market
          alongside big corporations and other powerful entities) to meet new
          audiences and expand their impact. Widespread access to the internet
          and net neutrality have been essential for providing Americans a
          better chance to succeed in the face of rising income inequality and
          continued machinations by corporate giants.




          We believe in upholding net neutrality as a condition of Internet
          Freedom, and will work with our colleagues in Congress and around the
          country to ensure that Congress once and for all adopts a legislative
          solution to uphold the open internet. We cannot afford to continue
          partisan jockeying on this issue that has changed consistently over
          the past ten years based on who occupies the which and which party in
          Congress dominates in the realm of legislative control. There is too
          much at stake and on the line to stop now. Internet Freedom is a must,
          and we will do what it takes to ensure that all people have the
          opportunity to access the internet freely, openly, and affordably.

**Opinion polls in the United States demonstrate that these policy positions are overwhelmingly popular.** Indeed, throughout the industrialized world these ideas are considered moderate. This is a movement about freedom and justice. And it’s a movement of, by, and for working people. If the Democrats refuse to embrace this platform, they’ll continue to lose, either to Republicans or to us.

**The future of the Democratic party is the Justice wing, not the establishment wing.**
