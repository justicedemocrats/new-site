      We need a bold economic vision that will both reclaim lost capital and put
      money back in the pockets of hard-working Americans, and create millions
      of new jobs for those who have been left out of the workforce.

          Scientists are sounding the alarm on climate change. Communities are
          fighting back. It’s time to drastically and immediately move away from
          fossil fuels, develop the technologies of the future, and create
          prosperity for all of us -- not just those on top. The Green New Deal
          is a mass mobilization to dramatically expand existing renewable power
          sources and deploy new production capacity with the goal of meeting
          100% of national power demand through renewable sources. The Green New
          Deal will also provide all members of our society, across all regions
          and all communities, the opportunity, training and education to be a
          full and equal participant in the transition, including through a job
          guarantee program to assure a living wage job to every person who
          wants one and ensure a ‘just transition’ for all workers, low-income
          communities, communities of color, indigenous communities, rural and
          urban communities and the front-line communities most affected by
          climate change, pollution and other environmental harm including by
          ensuring that local implementation of the transition is led from the
          community level and by prioritizing solutions that end the harms faced
          by front-line communities from climate change and environmental
          pollution.

          This is about justice and basic human decency. If you work hard and
          you work full time you shouldn’t live in poverty. Furthermore, we
          support strong unions and collective bargaining.

          The idea behind a federal jobs guarantee is that anyone who wants to
          work and contribute but can’t find a way to do that in the economy can
          do that. A federal jobs guarantee program would establish a floor for
          wages and benefits for the nation’s workforce. This program would
          provide a baseline minimum wage of $15 an hour and guarantee for
          public workers a basic benefits package, including healthcare and
          childcare. By investing in our own workforce, we can lift thousands of
          American families out of poverty and get people to work doing the work
          that needs to be done.

          Our infrastructure gets a grade of D from the Society of Civil
          Engineers. The government should invest trillions in rebuilding our
          crumbling roads, bridges, schools, levees, airports, etc. There’s no
          reason why we can’t have the world’s #1 infrastructure.

          Americans have lost millions of decent paying jobs due to unfair trade
          deals. It’s time to end the race to the bottom and renegotiate these
          rigged deals that only benefit elites. We should not sacrifice our
          sovereignty. The only people who are allowed to make laws for the
          United States should be the American people, not multinational
          corporations.

          Corporations dodge $450 billion a year in taxes by using offshore tax
          havens. We should end this injustice, as well as chain the capital
          gains tax to the income tax, increase the estate tax, and implement
          the Buffet Rule so that no millionaire CEO pays less in taxes than his
          or her secretary. It’s time for a tax system that benefits the middle
          class and the poor, and makes the top 1% and multinational
          corporations pay their fair share.

          The United States maintains 800 military bases worldwide at a cost of
          $100 billion a year. This is money that can be spent at home creating
          jobs, rebuilding infrastructure, and investing in the future of the
          people. The disastrous war in Iraq cost trillions, the war in
          Afghanistan is going on 17 years in with no end in sight, and we’re
          currently bombing 7 different countries. We spend more on our military
          than the next 8 countries combined. It’s time to end the wars and the
          perverse monetary incentive structure that makes politicians flippant
          about sending young men and women to die. Unilateral U.S. military
          force should only be used as a last resort to defend the nation. The
          current budget could be cut drastically if we used our department of
          defense for what it was intended — defending us, instead of waging
          interventionist wars.

          The United States should catch up to every other modern nation and
          implement a single payer, Medicare for All system. It’s time to end
          the destruction of American health care by rapacious, price gouging,
          for-profit, private health insurance middlemen.

          Educating the citizenry of a nation pays dividends in the long run,
          with the economy getting back much more than is initially put in.
          Crushing student debt for higher education would no longer burden
          young men and women trying to improve their lives through hard work.
          We should strive to have the best education system in the world.

          Republicans have been trying to privatize and cut earned benefit
          programs for decades. Corporate Democrats have been willing to go
          along with them under the guise of a ‘grand bargain’ and ‘reform’. We
          pledge to staunchly oppose this. Social Security reduced the elderly
          poverty rate from 35% to 10%. 3.4 million Americans would immediately
          fall into poverty without Medicaid. Gutting these vital programs is
          not an option.

          The United States is one of just three countries in the world that
          doesn’t offer paid maternity leave, the others being Oman and Papua
          New Guinea. We are the only industrialized nation that doesn’t offer
          paid vacation time. This should be changed immediately.

          Racism and xenophobia have always been part of our country's history.
          Since our nation's founding, the wealthy and the powerful have always
          used divide-and-conquer tactics to make working people fight each
          other instead of the people on top. African Americans and Latinos in
          particular, and people of color generally, have been targets in our
          nation’s continued assault against their rights, liberties, and
          humanity. As did generations before us, we will continue to advocate
          and push for justice, equity, and equality in all manner and forms,
          and will sponsor and vote on legislation to secure the same. We
          support a truth and reconciliation commission to investigate the
          generational harms caused by slavery and Jim Crow and propose
          remedies.

          We support the Paycheck Fairness Act and we support repealing the Hyde
          Amendment. We oppose Republican cuts to Planned Parenthood and women’s
          health clinics all across the country. In 2016 alone, 60 TRAP laws
          targeting abortion were passed in 19 states. We will vigorously oppose
          all efforts to dismantle reproductive rights.

          More than 600,000 Americans are homeless on any given night, including
          over 57,000 veterans. Studies show the cost of leaving a homeless
          person on the streets is $30,000 while the cost of housing them is
          just $10,000. Addressing this crisis is both the moral and fiscally
          responsible thing to do.

          For-profit policing and for-profit prisons should be abolished. Police
          training should be retooled to emphasize de-escalation tactics, and
          body cameras should be mandatory on all officers. Furthermore,
          community oversight boards should be created and broken windows
          policing should be eliminated. Stop & frisk — which disproportionately
          targets African Americans and Latinos 87% of the time — has a 97%
          failure rate. On top of being discriminatory and ineffective, it’s
          also unconstitutional and should be ended. Special prosecutors must
          also be appointed to hold police accountable. We should invest more in
          jobs and education, less in jails and incarceration.

          92% of Americans want expanded background checks, 54% want a ban on
          assault weapons, and 54% want a ban on high capacity magazines. We
          agree with the majority of the American people and support these
          measures. Over 30,000 Americans die every year from gun violence,
          including over 10,000 homicides. The time to act is now to address
          this public health crisis.

          Since 2013, with the U.S. Supreme Court’s disastrous Shelby County v.
          Holder decision, states across the country have been actively working
          to reverse the hard-fought protections for voting rights secured
          during the Civil Rights Movement. Fair and equal access to the ballot
          is essential to our ability to uphold and protect our nation’s
          democracy. We believe every American citizen is entitled to vote, and
          we will work to secure voting rights, challenge ultra-partisan
          gerrymandering, and put an end to affronts to our democratic
          representation.

      We cannot afford to continue partisan jockeying on these issues; there is

          ICE was created in 2003 as a reaction to 9/11. Since then, it has
          turned into a state-funded terror group that regularly violates basic
          human rights. We don't need a special enforcement agency for
          undocumented immigrants. We can rely on our existing criminal justice
          agency to arrest those who have committed a crime, just like we did
          before 2003.

          Super PACs should be banned, private donations to politicians and
          campaigns should be banned, and a clean public financing system should
          be implemented to end the takeover of our government by corporations
          and billionaires. Americans deserve free and fair elections — free
          from the corruption of big money donors. The Supreme Court has
          effectively legalized bribery. We need public financing of our
          elections.

          America imprisons more people than any other nation in the world. With
          4.4% of the world’s population, America incarcerates 22% of the
          world’s prisoners (716 per 100,000). Even as the national crime rate
          remains on a steady decline, incarceration rates continue to climb. On
          top of that, our criminal justice system currently targets Black and
          Brown people leading to higher arrest rates and longer sentences. That
          needs to end.


          Criminal justice reform requires sweeping and comprehensive policy
          changes that reverse our nation’s trends of unjust mass incarceration,
          and works to address the root causes of criminal behavior while
          mitigating the negative consequences of inappropriate policing
          practices.

          We won’t give an inch in our opposition to Trump’s outrageous
          proposals. Ideas like a ‘total and complete’ shutdown of Muslim
          immigration and deporting all undocumented immigrants are anathema to
          America. We will fight for comprehensive immigration reform with a
          path to citizenship. America is a proud nation of immigrants.

          We recently gave Saudi Arabia billions in weapons and watched the
          civilian death toll in their vicious bombing campaign in Yemen tick
          up. We continue sending Egypt arms as they violently crack down on
          peaceful protesters. Israel received $38 billion in aid and promptly
          announced new settlements. The first step to peace is not enabling
          nations who regularly violate international law.

          The racist War on Drugs has torn families apart all across our
          country. Politicians in both parties created a system of mass
          incarceration while divesting resources from the most vulnerable
          communities. Legalizing marijuana is a racial and economic justice
          issue. Black Americans are four times more likely than whites to be
          arrested for marijuana possession despite similar usage rates.
          Billions of taxpayer dollars are spent to uphold a racist system. 


          We must legalize marijuana and ensure that the records of those who
          were incarcerated for marijuana-related charges are expunged. As we
          legalize marijuana, we must also follow the models set in
          Massachusetts and Oakland that make sure that profits, investment, and
          business opportunities are going toward communities unfairly targeted
          by the racist war on drugs.

          Humans are fallible, we’ll never get the right answer 100% of the
          time. 4% of the people on death row are not guilty of a crime and have
          been wrongly convicted. A system that puts innocent people to death is
          indefensible and should be reformed. We want justice for the American

          73% of congressional districts in America are deemed "safely
          Republican or safely Democrat" and do not have competitive general
          elections. We support bold reforms to provide voters an equal say in
          our democracy. This includes efforts to expand the House of
          Representatives and the Fair Representation Act to create multi-member
          districts and ranked-choice voting. We also support the movement to
          provide statehood for Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico in order to
          bring balance to the increasingly skewed Senate. These efforts are in
          line with movements for racial and economic justice in our country. We

          These days, our reliance on technology has become second-nature, and
          the Internet has become a great enabler of industry, connectivity, and
          commerce. For all the wonders the internet provides, its benefits are
          fragile in that at any moment, large corporations seeking to pad their
          bottom lines and deliver outsized returns to their shareholders can,
          at any moment, hinder our access to the Internet - a platform for
          freedom of expression and medium for improving our lives.


          For more than a decade,  the Internet has served as a great equalizer,
          and has provided an opportunity and platform for small businesses and
          voices (who may not otherwise have a platform to compete in the market
          alongside big corporations and other powerful entities) to meet new
          audiences and expand their impact. Widespread access to the internet
          and net neutrality have been essential for providing Americans a
          better chance to succeed in the face of rising income inequality and
          continued machinations by corporate giants.


          We believe in upholding net neutrality as a condition of Internet
          Freedom, and will work with our colleagues in Congress and around the
          country to ensure that Congress once and for all adopts a legislative
          solution to uphold the open internet. We cannot afford to continue
          partisan jockeying on this issue. The rules have changed consistently
          over the past ten years based on who occupies the White House and
          which party in Congress dominates in the realm of legislative control.
          There is too much at stake and on the line to stop now. Internet
          Freedom is a must, and we will do what it takes to ensure that all
          people have the opportunity to access the internet freely, openly, and
          affordably.

**Opinion polls in the United States demonstrate that these policy positions are overwhelmingly popular.** Indeed, throughout the industrialized world these ideas are considered moderate. This is a movement about freedom and justice. And it’s a movement of, by, and for working people. If the Democrats refuse to embrace this platform, they’ll continue to lose, either to Republicans or to us.
