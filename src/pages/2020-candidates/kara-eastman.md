blurb: >-
  Kara Eastman is running against Republican Congressman Don Bacon in Nebraskaâ€™s
  second congressional district. In 2018, Eastman lost by two points (less than
  5,000 votes) in an R+4 district. Despite her success, the DCCC is reportedly
  attempting to recruit a candidate to run against Eastman in 2020. In 2018, the
  DCCC supported former Rep. Brad Ashford, who had a record as an anti-choice
  state legislator.
