          The two-party paradigm is the model for our country’s current
          political system. While we agree with and often champion many
          third-party candidates and movements, the reality is that right now it
          is next to impossible for a third-party candidate to win a national
          election.


          We want our democracy to work for Americans again as soon as possible.
          The best way to do this is by working to change the Democratic party
          from the inside out. Once Justice Democrats take power, we plan to
          implement electoral reform like ranked choice voting so third parties
          can have more power in our democracy.
        question: Why “Democrats”? Why not just start a new party?
      - answer: >-
          We are thrilled that so many new organizations have come forward to
          enact change. Some groups, such as Our Revolution are focusing on
          local and state elections. Brand New Congress has many of the same
          principles as us, but are attempting to recruit Congressional
          candidates to run as Republicans in red districts. Justice Democrats
          is recruiting and running Democrats all over the country (starting
          with Congress) and our belief is that strong Democrats with a real
          message have the best shot of winning anywhere — even red districts.
        question: >-
          How are you different from these other Democratic groups such as Brand
          New Congress and Our Revolution?
      - answer: >-
          Justice Democrats current leadership is Saikat Chakrabarti, Alexandra
          Rojas, Nasim Thompson, and Corbin Trent.
        question: Who is running Justice Democrats? Who are the major players?

      - answer: >-
          All candidates are required to pledge not to take any corporate PAC or
          corporate lobbyist money. Additionally, they will be progressive
          candidates who generally agree with the [**Justice Democrats
          platform**](/issues). Please check out the detailed description of who
          we are looking for at the top of our [**candidate endorsement
          form**](https://go.justicedemocrats.com/survey/application-endorsement/).
          Read about our candidates on our [**candidates page**](/candidates).
        question: ' Who are Justice Democrat candidates?'
      - answer: >-
          We won’t run against candidates that fully support the Justice
          Democrats platform, but we also know that challenging incumbents in
          primaries is the best way to make them start to listen to people over
          corporate donors.
        question: >-
          What about good candidates already in Congress? Are you going to run
          against them?

          Justice Democrats is a federal political action committee. We are
          required to be a PAC to accept donations and spend money toward
          electing federal candidates. PACs have a maximum contribution limit of
          $5,000 and must report all donations and expenditures. 


          This is not a SuperPAC, but a plain old regular PAC. You can learn
          more about PACs at [**fec.gov**](https://www.fec.gov).  


          The PAC uses donation money to hire staff that recruits and trains
          candidates, runs all Justice Democrats social media, send e-mails to
          the Justice Democrats e-mail list, manages the Justice Democrats
          website, answers all incoming e-mails to our help desk, create videos
          and other design assets that are used to promote Justice Democrats
          policies and candidates, handle inbound and outbound press
          communications, and also any other work involved with promoting
          Justice Democrats candidates as well as Justice Democrats issues.  


          In addition to promoting candidates, Justice Democrats PAC also
          promotes issues. For example, we worked with the National Nurses
          United to pressure over 45 Democrats to co-sponsor Medicare for All in
          the House, getting H.R. 676 up to 121 co-sponsors — the most it has
          ever received. 


          Justice Democrats PAC has a board with legal control over the entity.
          Board members are Saikat Chakrabarti, Alexandra Rojas and Nasim
          Thompson.


          One of Justice Democrats' goals is to get everyday, working people
          into Congress. Many of these people don't have a lot of campaign
          experience, and so in addition to endorsing candidates, Justice
          Democrats can help nascent campaigns get off the ground with the
          resources they need. These resources include a distributed field
          program in which candidates can opt-in to get access to an auto-dialer
          for voter contact, a texting tool for event turnout, a volunteer
          portal, and other general help on their field program. We also help
          candidates with recruiting campaign managers, message training, press,
          creative work, and a host of other services that campaigns require.  


          The FEC requires that we charge campaigns money for any direct
          campaign services we do (otherwise, the service would count as a
          donation to the campaign), so we do these services at-cost to us,
          making no profit. By creating a scalable infrastructure that
          candidates can use to run their campaigns, we are able to start
          creating a party-like infrastructure that not only endorses and
          fundraises for candidates, but also provides them with the tools and
          people necessary to run a successful campaign. If you are curious
          about what Justice Democrats charges its candidates, you can view our
          fee schedule here:

        question: What type of organization is Justice Democrats?
      - answer: 'Yes, it is the federal limit of $5,000 per year.'
        question: Do you have a dollar amount cap on donations from any one individual?
      - answer: >-
          Our designation as a Federal PAC does not allow us to receive
          anonymous or unlimited donations. Not only are we required by law to
          disclose all donors, but our platform is fundamentally opposed to
          corporate influence in American elections and pay-to-play politics in
          any form.
        question: Do you accept Dark Money? Will you be disclosing all donations?
      - answer: 'The American people, with an average donation of less than $16.'
        question: Who are the major funders?
      - answer: >-
          The [**Federal Election
          Commission**](http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/candcmte_info.shtml)
          posts all campaign filings publicly, where you are able to [**review
          all donor
          information**](http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/candcmte_info.shtml).
        question: Where can I go to see a list of your donors?

        question: Where can I buy merchandise to show my support?
      - answer: >-
          You can only donate if you are a US citizen or permanent resident. You
          can, however, volunteer your time. People overseas often make great
          HelpDeskers or Candidate Hunters.
        question: 'I’m not a US citizen, can I join/donate? Can I help in other ways?'
      - answer: >-
          Yes, you can! Members of the Armed Forces on active duty may join
          political groups, sign petitions, donate to candidates and groups, use
          bumper stickers and help with voting assistance programs. Read the
