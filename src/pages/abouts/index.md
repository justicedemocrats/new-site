  **Justice Democrats is working to elect a mission-driven caucus in Congress**
  that will fight for solutions that match the scale of our many crises:
  skyrocketing inequality, catastrophic climate change, deepening structural
  racism as the country becomes more diverse, and the corporate takeover of our
  democracy.


  We need a Democratic Party that fights for its voters, not its corporate
  donors. That’s why we helped elect leaders like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to
  Congress. We need leadership in the Democratic Party that will represent and
  fight for our communities.

          The two-party paradigm is the model for our country’s current
          political system. While we agree with efforts to reform our two-party
          system, the reality is that right now it is next to impossible for a
          third-party candidate to win a national election. Justice Democrats
          functions like a party within the Democratic Party -- running our own
          candidates in primary elections and holding those on top accountable
          to the grassroots.


          We want our democracy to work for Americans again as soon as possible.
          The best way to do this is by working to change the Democratic Party
          from the inside out. Once Justice Democrats take power, we support
          electoral reform like ranked choice voting and mixed-member districts
          so third parties can have a voice in our democracy rather than
          continue to play a spoiler effect.
        question: Why “Democrats”? Why not just start a new party?
      - answer: >-
          We are thrilled that so many new organizations have come forward to
          enact change. Some groups, such as Our Revolution are focusing on
          local and state elections. Brand New Congress has many of the same
          principles as us, but are attempting to recruit Congressional
          candidates to run as Republicans in red districts. Justice Democrats
          is recruiting and supporting progressive Democrats all over the
          country (starting with Congress).
        question: >-
          How are you different from these other Democratic groups such as Brand
          New Congress and Our Revolution?
      - answer: Justice Democrats current executive director is Alexandra Rojas.
        question: Who is running Justice Democrats? Who are the major players?
    title: GENERAL
  - items:
      - answer: >-
          All candidates are required to pledge not to take any corporate PAC or
          corporate lobbyist money. Additionally, they will be progressive
          candidates who generally agree with the [**Justice Democrats
          platform**](http://www.justicedemocrats.com/issues). Please check out
          the detailed description of who we are looking for at the top of our
          [**nomination page**](justicedemocrats.com/nominate). Read about our
          candidates on our [**candidates page**](/candidates).
        question: ' Who are Justice Democrat candidates?'
      - answer: >-
          We're looking for candidates who will actively build a movement around
          solutions that match the scale of the crisis.
        question: >-
          What about good candidates already in Congress? Are you going to run

          Justice Democrats is a federal political action committee. We are
          required to be a PAC to accept donations and spend money toward
          electing federal candidates. PACs have a maximum contribution limit of
          $5,000 and must report all donations and expenditures. 


          This is not a SuperPAC, but a plain old regular PAC. You can learn
          more about PACs at [**fec.gov**](https://www.fec.gov).  


          The PAC uses donation money to hire staff that recruits and trains
          candidates, runs all Justice Democrats social media, send e-mails to
          the Justice Democrats e-mail list, manages the Justice Democrats
          website, answers incoming e-mails to our help desk, create videos and
          other design assets that are used to promote Justice Democrats
          policies and candidates, utilize communications and digital strategies
          to drive progressive policies forward, and also any other work
          involved with promoting Justice Democrats candidates as well as
          Justice Democrats issues.  


          In addition to promoting candidates, Justice Democrats PAC also
          promotes issues. For example, we worked with the National Nurses
          United to pressure over 45 Democrats to co-sponsor Medicare for All in
          the House, getting H.R. 676 up to 121 co-sponsors — the most it has
          ever received. 


          Justice Democrats PAC has a board with legal control over the entity.
          Board members are Alexandra Rojas and Nasim Thompson.


          One of Justice Democrats' goals is to get everyday, working people
          into Congress. Many of these people don't have a lot of campaign
          experience, and so in addition to endorsing candidates, Justice
          Democrats can help nascent campaigns get off the ground with the
          resources they need. These resources include a distributed field
          program in which candidates can opt-in to get access to an auto-dialer
          for voter contact, a texting tool for event turnout, a volunteer
          portal, and other general help on their field program. We also help
          candidates with recruiting campaign managers, message training, press,
          creative work, and a host of other services that campaigns require.  


          The FEC requires that we charge campaigns money for any direct
          campaign services we do (otherwise, the service would count as a
          donation to the campaign), so we do these services at-cost to us,
          making no profit. By creating a scalable infrastructure that
          candidates can use to run their campaigns, we are able to start
          creating a party-like infrastructure that not only endorses and
          fundraises for candidates, but also provides them with the tools and
          people necessary to run a successful campaign.
        question: What type of organization is Justice Democrats?
      - answer: 'Yes, the Justice Democrats PAC has a federal limit of $5,000 per year.'
        question: Do you have a dollar amount cap on donations from any one individual?
