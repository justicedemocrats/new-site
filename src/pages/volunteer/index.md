  **Justice Democrats is working to elect a mission-driven caucus in Congress**
  that will fight for solutions that match the scale of our many crises:
  skyrocketing inequality, catastrophic climate change, deepening structural
  racism as the country becomes more diverse, and the corporate takeover of our
  democracy.


  We need a Democratic Party that fights for its voters, not just its corporate
  donors. Thatâ€™s why we helped elect leaders like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to
  Congress. We need leadership in the Democratic Party that will represent and
  fight for our communities.
