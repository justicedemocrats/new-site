blurb: >-
  A congressperson represents their people—at least, they’re supposed to.
  Congress today works to protect the bottom line of powerful multinational
  corporations, not people like us. My circumstances, my sentiments and my
  values are shared all around me in the 9th District. I believe I am the person
  who can represent the loud, resistant, beacon of social change that is the
  9th. I will fight for social and economic change against a system rigged for
  normal people like us to fail.
