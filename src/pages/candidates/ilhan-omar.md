  Born in Somalia, Ilhan and her family fled the country's civil war when she
  was eight years old. They lived in a refugee camp in Kenya for four years
  before coming to the United States, and eventually settling in the
  Cedar-Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis, in 1997. In 2016, Ilhan became
  the first Somali-American, Muslim legislator in the United States. She has
  been a devoted progressive activist for many years and through her advocacy
  work, she’s advanced important issues, including support for working families,
  educational access, environmental protection, and racial equity.
