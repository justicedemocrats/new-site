blurb: >-
  Dr. Stephany Rose Spaulding is a professor, pastor, and lifelong social
  justice champion who is ready to put people over politics. Everyone deserves
  to have representation in Congress and since 1972 there have been whole
  communities ignored in Colorado's 5th Congressional District. In Congress,
  Stephany will ensure universal health care is a right, champion advancements
  in renewable energies and climate justice, create inclusive economic policies,
  and protect our most vulnerable and marginalized populations.
