blurb: >
  Matt Brown is running for Governor of Rhode Island to roll back the current
  Governor's restrictions on abortion, to end her failed and discredited attempt
  to "buy" a strong economy by spending millions of dollars on corporate
  giveaways at the expense of local citizens, and to build a sustainable local
  renewable energy economy that would make Rhode Island the first state in the
  country to not only produce all of its energy from renewable resources, but
  also to export surplus renewable energy to other states.  Brown is the former
  Secretary of State of Rhode Island and co-founder of City Year Rhode Island
  and of the Nobel Peace Prize-nominated organization Global Zero, which works
  to reduce and eliminate nuclear weapons.
