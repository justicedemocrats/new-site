blurb: >-
  Derrick Crowe is a former Justice Democrat and self-proclaimed "science nerd"
  that ran to unseat one of the most anti-science, climate change-denying,
  pro-Trump Republicans in Congress. As a public servant with years of
  experience in public policy, he believes in facing the facts: Americans
  deserve better, more honest, more thoughtful leadership.
