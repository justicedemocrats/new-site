blurb: >-
  Bryan Caforio has spent his career taking on big banks, insurance companies,
  and corporations that have screwed people over since the financial collapse.
  He's seen firsthand a system rigged against consumers and working families
  because career politicians have written the rules to let the corporate special
  interests get richer at the expense of everyone else. It’s time we rip up
  those old rules and create a new system where special interests can’t take
  advantage of hard working Americans.
