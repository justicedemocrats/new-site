blurb: >-
  I have fought bullies all my life, and the biggest bullies in the world are
  governments and corporations that put profits before people. My experiences as
  a veteran and civil rights advocate prepared me to fight for your liberties in
  Congress. Together we will secure health care as a human right through
  Medicare for All, end mass incarceration, and ensure the right to an education
  with free public college.
