  Juana Matias, an immigrant and one of the first Latinas to serve in her state legislature, is running to represent the 3rd Congressional District of Massachusetts. Her experience as both a social worker and a lawyer makes her uniquely qualified to represent underserved communities and fight to make the American dream accessible to all, not just those born into wealth and power.
