blurb: >-
  As a scientist, activist, and single mother, Roza Calderon knows that we need
  leaders who represent real people’s needs over party interests. That means
  combatting climate change, fighting for Medicare for All, and building an
  inclusive economy--not because it’s popular, because it’s the right thing to
  do for California’s 4th District.
