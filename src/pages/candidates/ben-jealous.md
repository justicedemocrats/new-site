blurb: >-
  Ben Jealous is a civil rights leader, community organizer, investor in
  startups for good, educator, former investigative journalist and a Rhodes
  Scholar who has spent his life bringing people together to get big things
  done. Ben is running for Governor on a platform of bold, progressive ideas to
  address gaping inequality between the rich and poor, including raising the
  minimum wage to $15 an hour, passing Medicare for All to guarantee health care
  as a right, and ending student debt to make it possible for every Marylander
  to attend community college, public university, or learn a trade for free.
