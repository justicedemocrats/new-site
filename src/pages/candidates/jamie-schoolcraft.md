blurb: >-
  Jamie grew up in Missouri's 7th district, his grandparents were Southern
  Baptist minister’s in the community, and they taught him, from an early age,
  “if you’re awake you’re working to help people.” He has worked as a Fireman
  Paramedic, physicians assistant, and is the former Mayor of Willard for 2
  terms. He ran for state senate in a dark red district, got 46% of the vote,
  and personally knocked on 32k doors. He has a chance to win his race for
  Congress by reaching every small town in the district, and connecting with as
  many working class voters as possible.
