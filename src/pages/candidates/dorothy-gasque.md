blurb: >-
  While our representatives argue about whether or not to raise the minimum
  wage, families are struggling to make rent. Dorothy Gasque is running for
  Congress in Washington’s 3rd district to reform our government and return
  power to the people rather than the corporate interests Congress currently
  represents.
